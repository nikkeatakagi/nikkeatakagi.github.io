<center><p>Nikkea Takagi, a biracial Japanese artist, raised in San Jose, explores the process of personal healing within her brightly colored paintings. Most of her work depicts familiar characters submerged in their own tiny eco-systems, surrounded by teapots, plants, and lanterns. </p> <br><br>

<p>Nikkea’s work is deeply rooted in the process of self discovery and healing. To Nikkea, art is a practice of self-care and is deeply personal. “My art is constantly changing and evolving, as am I. This work does not exclusively represent me, but it is a reflection of my ever-expanding experience.” Nikkea values that we all relate to imagery uniquely according to our individual narratives. Through the use of playful colors, body-positivity, and small tokens of comfort, she hopes to invoke a sense of empowerment and empathy to all of those who view her work.</p><br><br>

<p>Nikkea Takagi is a budding artist in the Bay Area. Her goal is to more vulnerably present her own experiences as a personal act of energy clearing and as an offering to anyone in need of some compassion or connection.</p> <br><br></center>
